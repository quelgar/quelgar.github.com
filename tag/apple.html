</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>A few more points that occurred to me, following up on my last&nbsp;post.</p>
<h1>Whither the&nbsp;Mouse?</h1>
<p>Since its inception in 1984, the Mac user interface has obviously been
designed for desktop computers with a mouse and a keyboard. When notebook
computers came along and we wanted to be able to use them without carrying a
mouse everywhere, or without even a flat, stable surface to put the mouse on,
they had to emulate the mouse as best they could. This may now be&nbsp;reversing.</p>
<p>In the announcement of Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X Lion, there was great
emphasis placed on the use of multitouch gestures as a means of control. I
think Lion will be the first <span class="caps">OS</span> designed for notebooks with multitouch
trackpads, with the desktop Macs left to emulate the MacBooks as best they
can. If you consider that a sizeable majority of the hardware Apple sells
today is mobile and primarily operated via some form of multitouch instead of
a mouse, this move seems sensible. And all new desktop Macs ship with the
multitouch-capable <a href="http://www.apple.com/magicmouse/">Magic Mouse</a>
as standard&nbsp;now.</p>
<h1>The Costs of Supporting&nbsp;Java</h1>
<p>With regard to Java, there&#8217;s been a few comments along the lines of &#8220;all the
hardware Apple sells to Java developers must more than cover the cost of the
handful of engineers needed to keep maintaining Java&#8221;. I think this
underestimates the costs involved. Supporting Java means, in addition to the
engineers,&nbsp;that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java must be accounted for in development&nbsp;plans</li>
<li>Java must be accounted for in <span class="caps">QA</span>&nbsp;plans</li>
<li>Customer support needs to deal with&nbsp;it</li>
<li>Security vulnerabilities need to be investigated and&nbsp;fixed</li>
</ul>
<p>The true cost isn&#8217;t so much the money, it&#8217;s that it unavoidably diverts some
of the company&#8217;s attention from things it would rather focus on. While
continuing with Java support wouldn&#8217;t be hugely onerous for Apple, eliminating
distractions that aren&#8217;t bringing much benefit can really help&nbsp;competitiveness.</p>
<p>Also, as the vast majority of Java work (since the switch to Intel) has
been on the <span class="caps">GUI</span>, I&#8217;d expect the Java team knows the guts of the Mac <span class="caps">GUI</span> pretty
well by now. Engineering talent isn&#8217;t exactly a fungible resource. There&#8217;s
probably a development manager somewhere in Apple salivating at the thought of
having the Java people on her&nbsp;team.</p>
<h1>Apple and the Server&nbsp;Side</h1>
<p>Folks have pointed out that Apple is a heavy user of server-side Java in their
web services. I can think of many ways they can deal with that, and have no
idea which option they&#8217;ll take. But I think we can be sure they&#8217;ve got a plan
and aren&#8217;t leaving it to chance. And despite everyone (including me) getting
very animated over &#8220;Apple dropping Java&#8221;, it&#8217;s worth remembering that their
Java team isn&#8217;t going to be shutting down&nbsp;tomorrow.</p>
<p>More generally, Apple&#8217;s plans for the cloud are completely opaque to me right
now. We&#8217;re all assuming they have big plans for cloud services: they built that
<a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/10/05/apples-north-carolina-data-center-nears-completion/">huge new data centre</a>,
and their hardware strategy seems to imply more reliance
on cloud services in the future. The iPad&#8217;s greatest weakness is that so much
of its functionality, including just initialising it, requires <span class="caps">USB</span>
synchronisation with a <span class="caps">PC</span> or Mac. MobileMe syncing is great, but it only works
for a few&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>The new MacBook Air models were just announced,
including one with an 11&#8221; screen, which I think is a first for Apple
notebooks. When making the announcement, Steve Jobs said something like &#8220;we
think this is the future of MacBooks&#8221;. With their emphasis on mobile, wireless
use and limited storage, these too are crying out for more cloud&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>And I think this could be Apple&#8217;s greatest weakness. If I were Steve
Jobs, the thing that would worry me most about Android isn&#8217;t its &#8220;openness&#8221;
(however you care to define it), or the temporary situation of shelf-space in
<span class="caps">U.S.</span> phone outlets, but the fact it is backed up by the world&#8217;s best cloud
services. And they&#8217;re only going to get better. Obstacles remain, but the
movement towards doing more and more in the cloud is inexorable. Where Google
has no rival, Apple&#8217;s track record is not that great. The iTunes store is a
huge success, obviously, but it&#8217;s not really all that &#8220;cloudy&#8221;, as you need a
Mac with enough hard drive to hold all your content. MobileMe is expensive,
and often unreliable and slow; it really only survives due to the
first class client support on Mac and iOS. The iWork service is not bad, but
lacks Google&#8217;s killer feature of collaborative editing. Apple has its work cut
out for it when it comes to the&nbsp;cloud.</p>
<h1>Flash, Core Animation and&nbsp;Multitouch</h1>
<p>In my last post I claimed Flash didn&#8217;t support Core Animation or Multitouch.
Well, <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/johnyanarella/status/28742755151">@johnyanarella set me right on that</a>. Flash does support both of these. I haven&#8217;t used that many Flash apps, so now I&#8217;m wondering to what extent the multitouch support is actually used in&nbsp;apps.</p><p>There are <a href="../more-thoughts-on-apple-and-java.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>                </article>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>So Apple has quietly announced that it is <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#releasenotes/Java/JavaSnowLeopardUpdate3LeopardUpdate8RN/NewandNoteworthy/NewandNoteworthy.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010380-CH4-SW1">deprecating its support for Java on the Mac</a>. The wording was (not uncharacteristically for situations like this) a bit vague on the details of what this means. I think two things are definite: 1) Apple will continue to support Java 6 on Snow Leopard until it reaches end of life; which I think happens when the <span class="caps">OS</span> <em>after</em> Lion is publicly released. 2) Apple will not port Java 7+ to the Mac. The main unresolved question is whether Java 6 will be supported on Lion. My guess is that it will be ...</p>

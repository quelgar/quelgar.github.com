</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The more I use the <a href="http://www.playframework.com">Play Web Framework</a>, the more I like it. The &#8220;dev mode&#8221; is great, compiling everything that&#8217;s changed on the fly, including the statically checked routes and templates. But sooner or later we want to deploy our app for&nbsp;reals.</p>
<p>The <code>dist</code> target will package up your app into a zip file with a simple shell script to launch it. That&#8217;s fine as far as it goes, but of course I want to run it as a proper service that starts automatically when the machine boots and can be easily shutdown and restarted. My production <span class="caps">OS</span> of choice is Ubuntu. Let&#8217;s do&nbsp;this.</p>
<h1>Upstart</h1>
<p>I only learned about <a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com">Upstart</a> recently while researching this problem. It&#8217;s essentially an improved version of the traditional System V init system. This discovery made me very glad I chose Ubuntu, as Upstart is both powerful and remarkably simple to use once you know the basics. The <a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/">Upstart &#8220;cookbook&#8221;</a> might look a bit intimidating at first, but after a bit of playing around I found it was quite simple to do what I&nbsp;wanted.</p>
<p>By the way, Ubuntu still has the traditional System V init thing as well. I was happily using that for ages without any idea that it had a whole other more advanced init system controlling it. This is because Debian still uses the System V init by default, so all Debian packages use System V, and Ubuntu doesn&#8217;t want to re-do all that&nbsp;work.</p>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<p>This is how I got my Play server running with Upstart. This was all done on Ubuntu 12.10 and seems to be working well so far. Obviously, there are a number of choices I&#8217;ve made that could be made differently, so this is not the only way to do&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2>1. System user for&nbsp;Play</h2>
<p>I wanted a user dedicated to running Play servers.&nbsp;Easy:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> sudo adduser --system play
</pre></div>


<h2>2. Unzip your Play&nbsp;app</h2>
<p>Just unzip your Play app somewhere. For this explanation, I&#8217;m going to assume it&#8217;s unzipped to <code>/play/myapp-1.0</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>play</code> user will need to be able to write to the app&#8217;s&nbsp;directories:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> sudo chown -R play:adm /play/myapp-1.0
</pre></div>


<h2>3. Create an Upstart configuration&nbsp;file</h2>
<p>All Upstart &#8220;jobs&#8221; are defined by a file in <code>/etc/init</code> named <code>jobname.conf</code>. The &#8220;jobname&#8221; bit is what you call the job when starting it or checking its status or whatever. So let&#8217;s create a file <code>/etc/init/myapp.conf</code> as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre># Upstart configuration for myapp Play application

description &quot;Magellan Config Server&quot;

start on runlevel [2345]
stop on runlevel [!2345]

setuid play

console log

env PLAY_DIR=/play/myapp-1.0
env JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre1.7.0_17

exec $JAVA_HOME/bin/java -Dhttp.port=9001 -classpath $PLAY_DIR/lib/\* play.core.server.NettyServer $PLAY_DIR
</pre></div>


<p>All this stuff (known as <em>stanzas</em>) is described in the above mentioned Upstart cookbook, but I&#8217;ll go through it&nbsp;briefly.</p>
<p>The <code>start on</code>/<code>stop on</code> lines indicate that these actions are triggered by changes in the system&#8217;s runlevel. Upstart uses runlevels just like System V, and on Ubuntu levels 2 through 5 are all the same. There are many events that can be used to trigger start and stop, but for a standalone daemon process, these do the&nbsp;job.</p>
<p>The <code>setuid</code> stanza means the job will be executed as the specified user instead of root. This seems like a simple thing, but you&#8217;d be amazed how fiddly it can be to do this via traditional means if you need to pass environment variables&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>The <code>console log</code> stanza means that stdout and stderr are redirected to <code>/var/log/upstart/myapp.log</code>. This was useful when debugging why my job wasn&#8217;t starting. I&#8217;m going to change it to <code>console none</code> on my server as I no longer need this&nbsp;log.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just using the <code>env</code> stanzas to break out the path settings. There&#8217;s seems to be a whole lot more they can be used for in Upstart, but I haven&#8217;t needed to worry about that&nbsp;yet.</p>
<p>The <code>exec</code> stanza specifies the command to run to run the job. This is basically the command from the <code>start</code> script that Play provides for us. I&#8217;ve just replaced the explicit listing of all the jars with the newer classpath wildcard feature, and specified the port for Play to&nbsp;use.</p>
<h2>4. Start&nbsp;it</h2>
<p>Upstart jobs are controlled by the <code>initctl</code> command. But there are various alias commands to save some typing. For example, <code>sudo start foo</code> is the same as <code>sudo initctl start foo</code>. So, let&#8217;s start our Play&nbsp;app:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> sudo start myapp
</pre></div>


<p>Hopefully, you&#8217;ll be rewarded&nbsp;with:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>myapp start/running, process 1234
</pre></div>


<p>You can confirm&nbsp;with:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> ps -p 1234
</pre></div>


<p>If something went wrong, check <code>/var/log/upstart/myapp.log</code> for&nbsp;clues.</p>
<p>Some other&nbsp;commands:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> sudo status myapp
<span class="gp">$</span> sudo stop myapp
<span class="gp">$</span> sudo restart myapp
<span class="gp">$</span> sudo initctl list  <span class="c"># list all Upstart jobs</span>
</pre></div>


<h1>Port&nbsp;80</h1>
<p>Of course, we like our <span class="caps">HTTP</span> servers to use port 80 (and or 443). There are a few ways this can be arranged, here&#8217;s the ones I know&nbsp;of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run as root (don&#8217;t do&nbsp;this)</li>
<li>Redirect port 80 using the&nbsp;firewall</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authbind">authbind(1)</a></li>
<li>Use a <span class="caps">HTTP</span> reverse proxy. I&#8217;m experimenting with <a href="http://nginx.org">nginx</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve used authbind, it&#8217;s pretty straight-forward and works with the <span class="caps">JVM</span>. It&#8217;s good when you just have a single server that you want on port&nbsp;80/443.</p>
<p>As Play apps run standalone with their own embedded Netty web server, an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> reverse proxy seems like it will prove quite useful. If you have a bunch of Play apps using different ports, you can use the proxy to make them all appear as part of a single &#8220;server&#8221; on port 80 (distinguished by something like a path in the <span class="caps">URL</span> or by the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> &#8220;host&#8221; header). Nginx (pronounced &#8220;Engine-X&#8221;) can also do simple load balancing, which should allow us to leverage Play&#8217;s stateless style. I&#8217;m still experimenting with these features at this&nbsp;stage.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to get my Play app up and running as an Ubuntu service. I had to spend some time learning Upstart, but it was well worth it. Upstart takes care housekeeping such as tracking the service&#8217;s <span class="caps">PID</span> for you. Compare the short configuration file above to the System V script included with Ubuntu&#8217;s Tomcat 7 package, which weighs in at 296&nbsp;lines!</p>
